# Pathfinder

## 🗺️ Inspiration

Finding a career can be hard. Many students during their time in high school are only exposed to the "popular careers", when very stable, attainable, and good careers can fall through the cracks. We wanted to make a fun 3D experience allowing people to tell their stories and passions, and find a successful and fufilling career. It's not limited to students, our NPCs are equiped to talk to anyone of any age, of any background.

## 🌍 What it does

Our interactive 3D map allows users to:

- Explore various career paths by interacting with NPCs who share their stories and experiences.
- Receive personalized career recommendations based on their interests and skills.
- Access detailed information about different careers, including required skills, education, and potential salary.
- Engage in interactive activities and quizzes to better understand their career preferences.

## 🛠️ How we built it

**Frontend:** Three.js, React, Tailwind CSS for an exciting and clean UI.
**Backend:** Vite, Zustand, TypeScript for housing the site.
**AI:** GenAI for Career based questions, rating, classification, and scoring the user according to their choices.
**Models:** Open source models off of Poly Pizza & Sketchfab

## 🔧 Challenges we ran into

Combining all of the pieces of **Pathfinder** together to create a seamless functioning **3D** and **GenAI** career exploration experience was very challenging. The physical placement of objects in **Three.js** was a confusing challenge in of itself with objects seemingly appearing in entirely different locations after a _git push_.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

The biggest accomplishment in our eyes was the overall outcome of the 3D aspect. For all of us this was the first time we dived into the world of **Three.js** which has a rather steep learning curve. After spending a long long time reading various docs, we were able to successfully create a product we are proud of.

## 🎓 What we learned

- We learned a lot about the integration of **Three.js** and **GenAI**, combining complex 3D environments with AI-driven career advice.
- Strengthened our full-stack development skills, from frontend UI design to backend deployment.

## 🚀 What's next for Pathfinder

- **World Expansion:** Creating a more vast world with more possibilities and reach for the user.
- **Detailed Overview:** A more diverse layout of the options the user can explore to continue following their chosen path.
